# Speech to Text System using Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic speech-to-text system that converts spoken English audio into written text using a pre-trained speech recognition model. The system processes a short audio file and outputs the corresponding transcription.

The project is implemented using Python and standard speech recognition libraries, making it simple and easy to understand.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how speech recognition systems work and how pre-trained models can be used to convert audio input into text without building a model from scratch.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- Pre-trained Google Speech Recognition API

## Working of the System
1. The program loads an audio file in WAV format.
2. The audio data is processed using the SpeechRecognition library.
3. A pre-trained speech recognition engine is used to convert speech into text.
4. The recognized text is displayed as output.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python on your system.
2. Install the required library using pip
3. Run the Python script


## Output
After execution, the system displays the transcribed text corresponding to the spoken content in the audio file.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic understanding of speech recognition and demonstrates how existing libraries and pre-trained models can be used to build functional speech-to-text systems efficiently.
