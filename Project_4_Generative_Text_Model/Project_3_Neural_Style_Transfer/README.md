# Neural Style Transfer

## Project Overview
This project implements **Neural Style Transfer**, a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another image.

## Objective
To understand and apply convolutional neural networks for artistic image transformation.

## Model Used
- Pre-trained **VGG19** Convolutional Neural Network

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Working Principle
1. Content and style images are loaded.
2. Features are extracted using VGG19.
3. Style and content losses are computed.
4. An output image combining content and style is generated.

## Output
- Stylized image (`stylized_output.jpg`)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be used for creative applications like artistic style transfer.
